This is a simple implementation of the MS-Windows game
WinMine for DOS. It requires a Microsoft-compatible
mouse. You need Borland C to compile it.

I have seen a few other programs to implement this game,
and they have been really ugly. This implementation is
considerably more elegant and a lot shorter, mostly due
to exploiting the recursive nature of the game.

This program is really meant as an example for students
of C programming. 

There are two version: mine.c requires no mouse is is
plain C code, while mine_dos.c is the DOS version that 
requires mouse.
